## YOLO Object Detection

# Overview

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system first introduced in the paper You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection in 2016.

# Some key points:

    Uses a single neural network applied to the full image to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. This makes it extremely fast compared to systems that apply classifiers on sliding windows or selective search regions.
    The model divides the input image into a grid of S x S cells. Each cell predicts B bounding boxes, confidence scores for those boxes, and C class probabilities.
    Outperforms other detection methods like R-CNN, SSD while still maintaining real-time performance.

# Speed and Accuracy

The latest YOLOv3 model achieves a speed of 30 FPS on a Pascal Titan X GPU while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on standard datasets like COCO.

YOLOv3 is able to detect over 80 classes from the COCO dataset.

# Model Details

    YOLO models use a custom DarkNet backbone network for feature extraction.
    The model predicts bounding boxes using anchor boxes. It predicts the offsets from these anchor boxes as well as confidence scores for each box.
    The class probabilities are predicted for each box, which are conditioned on the presence of an object in that box.
    Non-max suppression is used to eliminate duplicate detections.

# Training

    YOLO is trained on the COCO object detection dataset containing 80 object categories.
    Data augmentation techniques like random cropping, flipping, and color jittering are used to increase robustness.
    The loss function sums errors from the bounding box coordinate predictions, object confidence predictions, and class predictions.
    Training uses tricks like batch normalization, high resolution imagery, and advanced optimization techniques.

# Usage

    YOLO can be used for real-time detection in images, videos or camera streams.
    It provides fast, accurate detection ideal for applications like surveillance, autonomous driving etc.
    OpenCV provides support for running YOLO models for inference.
    The detections can be visualized by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the image.
    Various pretrained YOLO weights are available online to use off-the-shelf.
